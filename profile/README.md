LighTouch is a smart camera designed to transform any video projection into an interactive touchscreen. Originally created as a graduation project ("Epitech Innovation Project") at EPITECH, a French IT school, LighTouch leverages advanced video analysis and Bluetooth technology to enable intuitive and seamless user interaction.

## Overview

LighTouch is placed on top of a video projector projection. When a user touches the projection surface, LighTouch analyzes the video signal to detect the touch points, converts these into clicks, and sends them to the host PC via Bluetooth. This transforms any standard projection into a fully interactive touchscreen, making it an innovative solution for presentations, interactive displays, and educational tools.

## Features

- **Interactive Touchscreen Conversion**: Transforms any video projection into a touchscreen interface.
- **Real-Time Video Signal Analysis**: Analyzes the projection area to detect touch points accurately.
- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Sends touch input to the host PC wirelessly via Bluetooth.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple setup and easy-to-use interface.
